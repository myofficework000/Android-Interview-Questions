1. Transform and Filter List Using Higher-Order Functions
Question:
Write a Kotlin function named processNumbers that takes a list of integers and two higher-order functions:

A transformation function (Int) -> Int to modify each element.
A filter function (Int) -> Boolean to remove unwanted elements.
Your function should apply the transformation first, then filter the numbers, and finally return the processed list.

Example Input:

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val result = processNumbers(numbers, { it * 2 }, { it % 4 != 0 })
println(result)
