Big companies often use Jenkins for large-scale CI/CD, while GitHub Actions is great for GitHub-based workflows. CircleCI is a middle ground.

Why Use CircleCI?
·Faster builds with parallel execution.
·Supports Docker, Kubernetes, and multi-environment testing.
·Works with GitHub, Bitbucket, and private repositories.
·More configurable than GitHub Actions but requires external setup.

 How to Use CircleCI?
1.Sign up at circleci.com and link your GitHub repo. Also enable plugin in marketplace
2.Create a .circleci/config.yml file in your repo.

here is an example of .circleci/config.yml
version: 2.1

// imports the CircleCI Android orb, which provides reusable commands and executors for Android projects.
orbs:
  android: circleci/android@1.0.0

// defines a build job that runs in a Docker container using the circleci/android:api-29 image.
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/android:api-29
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Download Dependencies
          command: ./gradlew androidDependencies
      - run:
          name: Run Unit Tests
          command: ./gradlew test
      - run:
          name: Assemble Debug APK
          command: ./gradlew assembleDebug
      - store_artifacts:
          path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
          destination: debug-apk
      - store_test_results:
          path: app/build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest

//steps includes:
checkout: Checks out your code from the repository.
run commands to download dependencies, run unit tests, and assemble the debug APK.
store_artifacts: Saves the generated APK as a build artifact.
store_test_results: Saves the test results for analysis.

3.Commit and Push the Configuration: Add the .circleci/config.yml file to your repository and push the changes. 
This action triggers CircleCI to start the pipeline based on your configuration.

4.Monitor Your Pipeline: Navigate to the CircleCI dashboard to monitor the progress of your builds, view logs,
and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

5.Utilize CircleCI Orbs for Enhanced Functionality: CircleCI offers orbs—shareable packages of CircleCI configuration—that can simplify your CI setup:
The CircleCI Android Orb provides commands and executors specifically for Android projects.
To use an orb, declare it in your config.yml file as shown in the example above.
