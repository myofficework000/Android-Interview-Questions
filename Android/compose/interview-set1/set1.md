# ðŸ§© Jetpack Compose

### 1. What is Jetpack Compose and how is it different from XML-based UI?
- modern, declarative UI toolkit
- introduced by google, part of android jetpack
- 100% in kotlin, no need xml layout resource file 
### 2. Why did Google introduce Jetpack Compose?
- better performance
- easy to customize UI dynamically
- higher code reusability 
### 3. What are Composables in Jetpack Compose?
- building block of compose
- defined hierarchically
- instruct system to create UI components
### 4. What are Modifiers and how do you use them?
- decorate and configure UI elements
- chain multiple modifier functions to apply multiple effects in sequence
- eg. height, width, padding, background, clickable 
### 5. How do Box, Row, and Column differ in Compose layouts?
- Box: simple, layering and alignment
- Row, Column: need both alignment and arrangement, can manage the scroll state
### 6. What is the use of Scaffold in Compose?
- automatic insets and innerPadding handling
- smart layout arrangement
- works well with TopAppBar, BottomNavigation, FAB and Drawer
### 7. How does Compose handle theming and Material Design?
- Material theme: apply consistent colors, typography and shapes across the app
- built-in support for Light and Dark Themes
- fully supports material and meterial3 components
- can adjust custom styling
### 8. How do you manage state in Jetpack Compose?
- state change, recomposition
- mutableStateOf
- remember, remembersavable
- external state, observeAsState(), collectAsState()
### 9. What is state hoisting in Compose and why is it important?
- moving the state variables to higher level composable and and pass it as para
- higher reusability of UI components
- more clear state management
- better separation of concern and testability 
### 10. Whatâ€™s the difference between `remember` and `rememberSaveable`?
- remember: retain state across recomposition
- rememberSavable: also survive the configuation change
### 11. What is a SideEffect in Jetpack Compose? What types are available (`LaunchedEffect`, `DisposableEffect`, etc.)?
- trigger external oprations
- LaunchedEffect: launch a coroutine tied to current composable's lifecycle
- rememberCoroutineScope: run some suspend function in composable
- DisposableEffect: do some clean up in onDispose{} 
### 12. Does Jetpack Compose have a lifecycle?
- implicit: composition -> recomposition -> dispose
### 13. How do you create a custom Composable?
- pass the modifier or some other specific style argument and lambda as para to a reusable composable
### 14. How do you use `LazyColumn` in Compose and how does it differ from `RecyclerView`?
- easier syntax, no need adapter and viewholder
- better state management, and recomposition, no need notifyDataSetChanged()
- can use key attribute in lazyitems to recompose only affected items rather than whole list
- no layoutmanager, need to use different composables to achieve grid and staggered
### 15. How can you add headers or footers in a `LazyColumn`?
- item() before or after the items()
### 16. How does Compose handle navigation?
- navigation graph
- navhost
- navcontroller
- existing UI components like: top bar, bottom navigation bar, drawer, etc.
### 17. What is `ComposeView` and `AndroidView` in Compose?
- use AndroidView to embed xml layout resourcefile into a composable function
- use ComposeView to embed an exsiting composable into xml as a tag
