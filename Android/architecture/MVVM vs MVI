What are the differences between MVI and MVVM, and which one would you prefer?

MVI is a reactive architecture pattern designed to manage UI states predictably.
It emphasizes unidirectional data flow, ensuring a single source of truth for the UI.

Similarly, MVI stands for three layers, model represents the state of the UI,often immutable and stored predictably;
view is the UI layer that renders the state and emits user interactions;
intent is the action or event triggered by the user or system and initiating state changes.

Advantages: 
Unidirectional flow ensures consistency and avoids race conditions.
It is easier to debug and test since all states are predictable.
Cooperate well with jetpack compose and kotlin flow.
Plus all the advantages already in MVVM.
