What are the differences between MVI and MVVM, and which one would you prefer? 

Differences Between MVI and MVVM
State Management:

MVVM uses LiveData or StateFlow to observe and update UI state reactively.
MVI maintains a single immutable State object, ensuring predictable state transitions.
Data Flow:

MVVM follows a bidirectional data flow where the ViewModel updates the View, and the View can notify the ViewModel of changes.
MVI follows a unidirectional data flow where the View dispatches Intents, which modify the State centrally.
User Actions Handling:

In MVVM, the ViewModel directly processes user inputs and updates UI state accordingly.
In MVI, user actions are wrapped in Intents, which are then processed to produce a new State.
State Representation:

MVVM updates the UI incrementally, modifying only necessary UI elements.
MVI replaces the entire UI State whenever an update occurs, making state changes more predictable.
Predictability & Debugging:

MVVM can become unpredictable if multiple sources modify the UI state.
MVI is more predictable as state transitions are explicit and easier to track.
Complexity & Code Maintenance:

MVVM is simpler to implement and easier to understand for most applications.
MVI is more structured but adds complexity, making it better suited for applications with complex UI state management.
Best Use Cases:

MVVM is best for apps with moderate UI state needs, real-time updates, and simpler logic.
MVI is better for apps that require strict state control, history tracking, undo/redo functionality, and predictable UI behavior.

Which One Would I Prefer?
MVVM with Clean Architecture is my preferred choice for most Android applications due to its simplicity, maintainability, and compatibility with Jetpack components.
MVVM provides better separation of concerns, making it easier to scale and test applications.
MVVM offers more flexibility, allowing developers to manage state efficiently without the added complexity of strict unidirectional data flow.
MVI is a better choice for complex applications where UI state transitions need to be fully controlled, such as chat applications, financial dashboards, and applications with history tracking.
For standard Android applications with real-time data and moderate UI complexity, MVVM is the optimal choice, while MVI should be used when predictable state handling is a top priority.
