# ANDROID 14 BEHAVIORAL CHANGES
Android 14 introduces several behavioral changes that may affect your app's functionality and user experience. Below is a summary of key updates developers should be aware of.

1. CORE FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES
Foreground Service Types Requirement:
Apps targeting Android 14 (API level 34) or higher must specify at least one foreground service type for each foreground service. This ensures that services are appropriately categorized, improving system resource management.

Bluetooth Connect Permission Enforcement:
The BLUETOOTH_CONNECT permission is now mandatory when calling BluetoothAdapter.getProfileConnectionState(). Ensure your app declares this permission in the AndroidManifest.xml and checks for it at runtime.

JobScheduler Behavior Reinforcement:
JobScheduler now requires onStartJob() and onStopJob() to return within a few seconds.
Exceeding this time may trigger an ANR (Application Not Responding) error.
The ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission is now required when using network constraints.

2. PRIVACY ENHANCEMENTS
Partial Access to Photos and Videos:
Users can now grant apps access to specific images and videos instead of the entire media library. Use the READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED permission to support this feature.

Secure Full-Screen Intent Notifications:
Full-screen intent notifications are now restricted to apps providing calling and alarm functionalities.
The USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT permission is required, and misuse may lead to policy enforcement actions.

3. SECURITY UPDATES
Implicit and Pending Intent Restrictions:
Implicit intents can only be sent to exported components.
For non-exported components, use explicit intents.
Creating mutable pending intents without specifying a component or package will now result in an exception.

Dynamic Code Loading Restrictions:
Apps using Dynamic Code Loading must ensure all dynamically loaded files are marked as read-only.
Failure to do so will result in a system exception.

4. BEHAVIOR CHANGES AFFECTING ALL APPS
Exact Alarms Permission:
The SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission is no longer pre-granted to most newly installed apps targeting Android 13+.
Apps must explicitly request this permission, and users can manage it in system settings.

Broadcast Queuing for Cached Apps:
Context-registered broadcasts may be queued while the app is in the cached state.
These broadcasts will be delivered when the app moves to the foreground.
Manifest-declared broadcasts are not queued.

Limitation on Killing Background Processes:
killBackgroundProcesses() API can now only terminate background processes of the calling app.
Attempts to kill other appsâ€™ background processes will no longer work.

5. OPENJDK 17 UPDATES
Android 14 aligns with OpenJDK 17, introducing changes such as:
Stricter regular expression handling
UUID validation changes
Ensure your app is thoroughly tested for compatibility with these updates.
