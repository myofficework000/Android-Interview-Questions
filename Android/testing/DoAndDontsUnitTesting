Do's 
Always use a proper Testing Framework. Use Junit for unit tests.
Always mock the dependencies using mockk library. Instead of making actual network calls.
Write Unit tests for viewmodel, Repository, Usecase independently, Avoid testing multiple components in a single test.
Make sure each test should be independent and not rely on other tests.
Use StandardTestDispatcher for testing suspend functions and coroutines. StandardTestDispatcher is used to execute the coroutines synchronously. Also if there are any delays it will ignore them. So with standardTestDispatcher we can avoid race conditions and flakey test cases.

Don'ts
Don’t Write Tests That Depend on Network Calls. Always mock API responses instead of making real network calls.
Don’t Use Hardcoded Delays in Tests
Don’t Ignore Flaky Tests. If a test fails randomly, debug and fix it instead of ignoring it.
Don’t Run Tests on the Main Thread. Use runBlockingTest {} for coroutines to avoid ANRs.
Don’t Ignore Code Coverage. Aim for at least 80% coverage but focus on critical paths.
