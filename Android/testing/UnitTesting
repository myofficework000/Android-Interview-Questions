Tell me 3 do's and don't of Unit testing, consider you are using mvvm as architecture and mockk as mocking framework.
Do
1. Test one thing at a time
2. Use meaningful test name
3. Try to cover all scenarios
4. When working with coroutine, use standardTestDispatcher


Don't
1. Don't test private method directly
2. Don't mock what you can easily instantiate
3. Don't forget to unmockAll() after mocking some singleton
4. Test the whole behavior rather than just the final value
